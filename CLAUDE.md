# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

HoneyPot is a Discord bot (Rust, `serenity`) that automatically bans spam bots.
It watches for "honeypot" traps — configured roles that trigger a ban when
acquired, and channels that trigger a ban when posted in — and acts on offenders.
It is distributed as a Docker image; there is no CLI beyond the running daemon.

## Commands

```shell
cargo build                                   # debug build
cargo build --release --bin honeypot          # release binary (as Docker builds it)
cargo run                                      # run locally (loads .env, reads config/config.toml)
cargo run --features preview                   # post sample log embeds and exit (see Preview mode)
cargo test                                     # all tests
cargo test --verbose deserialize_single_guild # a single test by name
cargo fmt --all -- --check                     # rustfmt check (CI gate)
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features      # clippy (CI gate)
cargo llvm-cov --all-features --workspace      # coverage (matches CI; needs cargo-llvm-cov)
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`) gates on rustfmt, clippy, `cargo test`, and
coverage, then cross-builds for Linux (gnu/musl), macOS (x86_64/aarch64), and
Windows. The toolchain is pinned to stable via `rust-toolchain.toml`; the crate
uses **edition 2024**.

## Running locally

Requires a real Discord bot token and a live gateway connection.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `HONEYPOT_BOT_TOKEN`.
2. Copy `config/config.example.toml` to `config/config.toml` and fill in guild IDs.
3. `cargo run`.

The bot needs the **`GUILD_MEMBERS`** and **`MESSAGE_CONTENT`** privileged
intents (both enabled in the Discord Developer Portal) and the **Ban Members**
and **View Audit Log** permissions in every moderated guild. If either intent is
disabled the gateway refuses the connection. `MESSAGE_CONTENT` is requested so a
channel-triggered ban can log the offending message for moderator review; the
content is only ever read to populate that log embed. **View Audit Log** lets the
role path resolve who granted a honeypot role (see the account-type policy);
without it every role trigger falls back to manual review.

### Dry-run mode

Set **`HONEYPOT_DRY_RUN=1`** (or `true`) to debug without a throwaway account.
In dry-run the three destructive Discord calls (`ban_with_reason` in `execute_ban`
and `confirm_bot_ban`, `unban` in `perform_unban`) are skipped and treated as
success, while detection, log-embed posting, buttons, the two-step confirmation,
embed edits, and `HANDLED_BANS` claim/release all run for real. So you can trip a
honeypot on your own account and watch the whole flow — the log embed carries a
`⚠️ DRY-RUN` footer — without actually being banned. The flag is read once at
startup via `settings::dry_run()`; a startup `warn!` line confirms it is active.

### Preview mode

The **`preview`** Cargo feature (off by default) swaps the daemon for a one-shot
embed previewer. With it, `main`'s `run()` reads `HONEYPOT_PREVIEW_CHANNEL`, posts
one message per log-embed variant *in each supported language* (built with the
*real* builders, so previews can't drift) to that channel via REST, and exits —
no config load, no gateway. The captions are language-tagged (`[EN]`/`[JA]`).
Run it with `cargo run --features preview`. Lives in `src/discord/preview.rs`;
`main.rs` selects the preview vs. normal `run()` with `#[cfg(feature = "preview")]`
(and allows dead code crate-wide under the feature, since the normal path is then
uncompiled). To reach the previewer, `build_ban_embed`/`build_pending_embed`/
`build_third_party_grant_embed` (ban.rs) and `resolved_embed`/
`manually_banned_embed` (interaction.rs) are `pub(crate)`. None of this is
compiled into the production image.

## Architecture

Data flows in one direction: TOML file → raw config → runtime settings → event
handlers → ban module → Discord.

- **`src/config.rs`** — raw `config.toml` representation. IDs are bare `u64`
  here (`GuildConfigEntry`), plus an optional `language` (defaults to `en`). Owns
  file loading/parsing only.
- **`src/settings.rs`** — converts raw entries into `serenity` ID types and
  stores them in a global `OnceLock<HoneyPotConfig>` keyed by `GuildId` for O(1)
  lookup. `HoneyPotConfig::init()` is called once from `main`; `::get()` panics
  if called before init. Config path defaults to `config/config.toml`, overridable
  via `HONEYPOT_CONFIG_PATH`. Also owns `dry_run()` — the cached `HONEYPOT_DRY_RUN`
  flag that the ban paths consult to skip the actual Discord ban/unban calls.
  `GuildConfig` also carries the guild's `language` (see `src/i18n.rs`).
- **`src/i18n.rs`** — per-guild localization for all moderator-facing text. The
  `Language` enum (`en`/`ja`, deserialized from the `language` config key,
  defaulting to `en`) and one `const Messages` catalog per language. Both catalogs
  are `const`, so adding a `Messages` field forces every language to define it or
  the crate fails to compile — translation gaps are build-time errors. The chosen
  `Language` is threaded into every embed/response builder in `ban.rs` and
  `interaction.rs`; detection logic stays language-free. The audit-log ban reason
  is deliberately **not** localized (kept English via `BanTrigger::kind`).
- **`src/main.rs`** — bootstraps `.env` (missing file is not an error), JSON
  `tracing` logging (`RUST_LOG`, default `honeypot=info`), config, and the
  serenity client with the four gateway intents.
- **`src/discord/handler.rs`** — the `EventHandler`. Captures the bot's own
  user ID on `ready` (guards against self-bans via `is_self`). `guild_member_update`
  and `message` detect triggers and funnel through `act_on_trigger`, which routes
  by account type (see below). `interaction_create` dispatches button clicks.
- **`src/discord/ban.rs`** — shared ban execution and the pure, unit-tested
  detection predicates (`newly_acquired_honeypot_role`, `is_honeypot_channel`,
  `find_role_grant_executor`, `classify_role_grant`). Also owns the audit-log
  lookup (`resolve_role_grant_source`) that distinguishes a self-assigned role
  from a third-party grant. Builds all log embeds and encodes/parses button
  `custom_id`s.
- **`src/discord/interaction.rs`** — handles the log-embed buttons (`Unban`,
  and `Ban` for manual bot confirmation), gated on the clicker's `BAN_MEMBERS`
  permission. Each button opens a two-step ephemeral confirmation
  (`Confirm`/`Cancel`) — only the `Confirm` click actually bans/unbans and
  rewrites the original log embed.
- **`src/error.rs`** — `HoneyPotError`, the single error type and `main`'s return.

### Account-type policy (the core rule)

When a honeypot fires, `act_on_trigger` branches on the offender:

- **Non-bot user** → banned immediately (`execute_ban`).
- **Bot in `trusted_bot_ids`** → ignored entirely (e.g. a link-expander that
  legitimately echoes into a honeypot channel).
- **Any other bot** → *not* auto-banned. A notice with a `Ban` button is posted
  to the log channel for manual moderator review (`execute_suspicious_bot_notice`
  → `confirm_bot_ban`). The rationale: bots can only be added by an admin, so
  err on the side of caution.

### Role-grant safeguard (role trigger only)

A **role** trigger has a prior check, applied in `guild_member_update` before
`act_on_trigger`. The trap is meant for a member who acquires the role
*themselves* (onboarding / self-assign) — the path a spam bot takes — so the
handler resolves the grantor via `resolve_role_grant_source` (audit log,
`MEMBER_ROLE_UPDATE`) and branches on `RoleGrantSource`:

- **`SelfAssigned`** (executor == target) → falls through to `act_on_trigger`
  (the normal account-type policy above).
- **`ThirdParty`** (an admin by hand, a reaction-role bot) **or** **`Unknown`**
  (missing/lagging audit-log entry, or missing `VIEW_AUDIT_LOG`) → *not* fired.
  A notice with a `Ban` button is posted for manual review
  (`execute_third_party_grant_notice` → `confirm_bot_ban`).

Discord can't distinguish onboarding from any other self-assign (both record the
member as executor), and both are intended to fire — so the axis is
self-assign vs. third-party, not onboarding vs. manual. `Unknown` deliberately
holds for review (never auto-bans) so an unverifiable grant can't cause a false
ban. The channel trigger has no such check: posting is always the offender's own
act. The two review notices share `build_review_embed`/`build_review_message` and
the same `uhp_ban` confirmation flow; only their title/description differ.

### Two invariants worth knowing

- **The serenity cache is disabled.** So `guild_member_update` fires for a
  honeypot-role holder on *any* member update (nickname, timeout, …), and the
  "old roles" set is usually unavailable. `newly_acquired_honeypot_role` handles
  both: it diffs against old roles when present, otherwise falls back to
  intersecting the full new role set with the honeypots. When editing role
  detection, keep both paths correct.
- **`HANDLED_BANS` deduplicates by `(guild, user)`.** An offender can trip both
  honeypot paths at once, or `guild_member_update` can fire repeatedly. Every ban
  path *claims* the pair first (`claim_ban`) and acts only on the first claim. A
  *failed* ban/notice releases the claim (`forget_ban`) so a later event retries;
  a successful unban also releases it so the user can be re-banned. Preserve this
  claim/release discipline in any new ban path.

## Conventions

- **Fire-and-forget event handlers.** Gateway handlers log errors via `tracing`
  and swallow them rather than propagating — a failed log post must not undo a
  successful ban. Match this style.
- **Detection logic stays pure and HTTP-free** so it remains unit-testable; tests
  live in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` at the bottom of each module. Add tests there
  when touching predicates or `custom_id` encoding.
- **Button `custom_id`s** are `uhp_unban:{user_id}` / `uhp_ban:{user_id}` (the
  log-embed buttons), `uhp_unban_do:{user_id}:{message_id}` /
  `uhp_ban_do:{user_id}:{message_id}` (the ephemeral `Confirm` buttons, which
  carry the log message id so it can be edited in place), and `uhp_cancel`. The
  prefixes deliberately do not collide; there are tests asserting this.
- **User-controlled text** (e.g. usernames in embeds) is sanitized — see
  `target_field`, which neutralizes backticks to prevent embed-layout spoofing,
  and `message_field`, which neutralizes backticks and truncates the logged
  message to stay within Discord's embed field limit.

## Releases

Automated by **release-please** (`release-please-config.json`, release-type
`rust`). Commits must follow **Conventional Commits**; `feat`/`fix`/`chore`/`ci`
map to changelog sections. Merging the release PR bumps `Cargo.toml`, updates
`CHANGELOG.md`, tags, and triggers the Docker image publish to
`ghcr.io/m1sk9/honeypot`. Do not hand-edit the version or changelog.

Rustdoc for `main` is published to GitHub Pages (`.github/workflows/docs.yaml`,
built with nightly `--document-private-items`) — module-level `//!` docs are the
primary architecture reference and are kept thorough.
